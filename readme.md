# react-min

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-5.0.0-brightgreen)
![supported node version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-LTS-brightgreen)

This is near to base setup for any other project.
I only added react dependencies.

## Setup

### Install

* `git clone `
* `npm ci`

### Create files

* create `src/index.js`.
  ```js
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
  
  function App() {
      return "Hello WORLD"
  }
  
  ReactDOM.render(
      <App />,
    document.getElementById("root")
  );
  ```
* create `public/index.html`
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
> Example branch: [react-min-src](https://github.com/nikhilnayyar002/react-min/tree/react-min-src). This repo also has all the [optional features](#optional-features) enabled.
## Commands

Commands | Inf
-|-
start | dev mode.
build | generate build files.
wm | run `wm-script.js` script with arguments.
speed-measure-dev | measure speed in dev mode.
commit | run **commitizen**. creates standard commit.
release | run **standard-version**. creates standard release.

## Optional Features

Enable/Disable optional features in the project. The feature setup is already added in the project but to enable/disable them you have to run commands. The commands actually install packages and set private variables in `wm-config.js` to keep track of features.

### typescript
* enable: 
  ```
  npm run wm -- enable-feat-typescript
  ```
  Replace `index.js` with `index.tsx` (filename's are defined in `wm-config.js`).
* disable: 
  ```
  npm run wm -- disable-feat-typescript
  ```
  Replace `index.tsx` with `index.js` (filename's are defined in `wm-config.js`).

### sass
Adds [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* enable: 
  ```
  npm run wm -- enable-feat-sass
  ```
* disable: 
  ```
  npm run wm -- disable-feat-sass
  ```
### Enable/Disable multiple features (in single command)
```
npm run wm -- enable-feat-typescript enable-feat-sass
npm run wm -- disable-feat-typescript disable-feat-sass
```
### Update all features
This command update every feature dependencies.
```
npm run wm -- update-feat-all
```

## Updating the setup

You should generally update the setup after every release.

If you have made changes to any root files like `wm-config.js`, `webpack.dev.js` etc. that is you made custom changes. Then run the following command to review changes before overwriting your changes:

```
git fetch
git merge origin/master --no-ff --no-commit
```

Otherwise if you have not changed any of root files:

```
git pull origin master
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

If you have installed any [optional features](#optional-features) then run [update](#update-all-features) command as well.

> Also you should avoid pulling `package-lock.json` if your dependencies in `package.json` are not exact as of **react-min/master**. Instead maintain your own  `package-lock.json`. Packages differ when you enable [optional features](#optional-features) that may install its own packages or user might install its own custom packages.

## Features

* add [env variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) (in use in app only). Example:
  * add `HELLO = WORLD` in file say `.env`
  * Then in `wm-config.js`. Add `"HELLO"` for it to be available in your App.
    ```js
    const wmConfig = {
        ...
        environmentVariablesInApp: ["HELLO"]
    },
    ```
    In your App
    ```js
    console.log(process.env.HELLO)
    ```
  > env variables starting with `REACT_MIN_` are automatically added.
* add svg as component: Append `?react` after file path in import statement in order for this to work.
  ```js
  import MySvg from '@assets/react.svg?react';
  import mySvg from '@assets/react.svg';
  
  function App() {
      return (
       <>
         <MySvg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 3500 3500" />
         <img src={mySvg} width="200" height="200" />
       </>
      )
  }
  ```
  > Second svg is not imported as component but will be resolved as string by webpack.
* import other files:
  ```js
  import sampleImg from '@assets/sample.jpeg';
  import sampleJson from '@assets/sample.json'; // { "hello" : "world" }
  import helloTxt from '@assets/hello.txt';

  console.log(sampleJson.hello)

  function App() {
      return (
       <>
         <pre>{helloTxt}</pre>
         <img src={sampleImg} width="200" height="200" />
       </>
      )
  }
  ```
* Directly edit webpack config as you like (`wm-*.js`, `webpack.*.js` files)
* edit [standard commit types](#commit-types) in `.czrc` file. This file is used by **commitizen**.
* edit `.versionrc.js` file used by **standard-version**.
* edit babel setup in `wm-config.js` (`browserslist`, `wmConfig.babel`)
* edit eslint (`.eslintrc.js`)
* update typescript (`tsconfig.json`). add custom modules types in `index.d.ts` file.
* `publicPath` can be changed in `wm-config.js`. `publicPath` is similar to [homepage field in CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#building-for-relative-paths).
* `publicPath` can be included in index.html and in code. [See](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/).
  ```
  // index.html
   <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />

  // code
  process.env.PUBLIC_URL
  ```

## Commit Guidelines

This repo use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) & [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for generating releases, tags & changelogs.

### Commit types

* ‚ú® Features (minor)(public): when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance (patch)(public): internal performance improvements
* üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes (patch)(public): when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. internal dependency updates "fix(deps)" etc
* üìù Docs(public): project documentation updates
* ‚õèÔ∏è Chore(private): Code Styling, Refactor, changes that are categorised as other and does not bring any version update.
* ‚òëÔ∏è Tests(private): add code to test your code

* [Guide](./guide.md)

## Important Notes

* `process.env` is initialized with custom environment variables only in file `wm-config.js` since it imports `dotenv-flow` which loads variables in `.env.*` files and also add some special variables to `process.env`.
